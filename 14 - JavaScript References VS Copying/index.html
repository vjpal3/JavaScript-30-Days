    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    team[3] = "Lux";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    console.log();
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
     // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // and think we make a copy:

    console.log(person, captain);
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const chef = Object.assign({}, person, {location: "New York", age: 20});
    chef.name = "Sarah";
    console.log(person, chef);
    
    // object ...spread
    // const manager = { ...person };
    // manager.age = 50;

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //hacky way of deep cloning:
